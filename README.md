The script 'Check_storms_North_Atlantic.py' download and read a KMZ file from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) webpage to check for exiting storms in the North Atlantic basin. If there are active storms, this code produces horizontal slides of temperature and salinity and other plots from the Global Ocean Forecasting system (GOFS 3.1) and Real Time Ocean Foreacsting System (RTOFS) model, by calling 'Surf_fields_models_baffin.py'. The code also looks for Argo floats for that day in the region where the storm is present, and compare then with profiles from the GOFS and RTOFS models.
